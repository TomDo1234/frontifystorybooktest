## Storybook - specify a unique state for a store per story.

In `packages/mars-theme/src/components/MenuModal/tests/MenuModalHome.story.js`

I would like the state to contain `router: { link: "/" }`, and I expect the "Home" link to be yellow.

In `packages/mars-theme/src/components/MenuModal/tests/MenuModalNature.story.js`

I would like the state to contain `router.link = "/category/nature/"`, and I expect the "Nature" link to be yellow.

I tried moving the store to each story and create its own store with the specified state. The store,
seems to be global thus changing it one place affects the other story.

## Absoulte Paths

https://medium.com/better-programming/use-absolute-paths-with-react-51ced66f119f

I was unable to configure the absolute paths. Ideally I'd like to use the base path of: `packages/mars-theme/src/`

I'd like this, in VSCode, jest and frontity.

## @whitespace/storybook-addon-html/react conflicts with Jest.

THis is not as important as the above issues but when I uncomment the following and run `npm run test:generate-output` I get all sort of jest errors.

```
// File: frontity-storybook/.storybook/preview.js

import { withHTML } from "@whitespace/storybook-addon-html/react";
addDecorator(withHTML);
```

## Syntax issue with MDX and Jest

In both mdx, and js version of a story I've got a test defined. But it only shows up in the CSF version.

`packages/mars-theme/src/components/MenuModal/tests/MenuModalStory.stories.js`

<img src={testFoundImage} />;

`packages/mars-theme/src/components/MenuIcon/tests/MenuIcon.stories.mdx`

<img src={noTestFoundImage} />;
